# Manifold Tracing using FK-Triangulation

This is an implementation of the Freudenthal Kuhn Triangulation based manifold from the Thesis paper "Meshing Submanifolds using Coxeter Triangulation" by **Siargey Kachanovich**. This repository contains the implementation specifically for tracing manifolds of co-dimension 1 manifolds i.e. Ambient space dimension is d and the manifold dimension is d-1. 

For the actual implementation of the code please refer to the [GUDHI documentation](https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/)
